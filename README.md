# Object-Oriented Programming (COP 3330)

GitHub repository to document my Java-learning journey

## Classes & Packages
```src/helloWorld.java```: my first .java file to test the waters w/ Java syntax<br>
```src/DoorRoulette.java```: a quick game I made in two hours utilizing the Random utility import<br>
```src/MethodArr.java```: learned how to set up methods and 2D arrays<br>
```src/oriented```: my first package; demonstrates object oriented programming by using classes<br>
```src/inheritance```: package utilizing inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and abstraction<br>
```src/smarthome```: package utilizing inheritance, absrtaction, and (soon) file I/O<br>

My preferred IDE for Java is Intellij IDEA, and ocassioanlly Eclipse

## How to Compile & Run
1. Change directory to ```src``` (assuming new files were made in the src folder);
- run ```cd src``` in terminal
2. Compile entire package (a folder of classes) of which the new file/package was changed since last compilation;
- run ```[packagename]/*.java``` in terminal
- example: ```inheritance/*.java``` compiles all .java classes in the inheritance package
3. Run the Main class from ```src``` directory;
- run ```[packagename].[Mainclassname]``` in terminal
- example: ```inheritance.Main``` (name of Main class is subject to however it was named by the developer)

I mainly follow this video to learn Java/Object-Oriented Programming:<br>
