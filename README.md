## Object-Oriented Programming (COP 3330)

GitHub repository to document my Java-learning journey:

```src/helloWorld.java```: my first .java file to test the waters w/ Java syntax<br>
```src/DoorRoulette.java```: a quick game I made in two hours utilizing the Random utility import<br>
```src/MethodArr.java```: learned how to set up methods and 2D arrays<br>
```src/oriented```: my first package; demonstrates object oriented programming by using classes<br>
```src/inheritance```: package utilizing inheritance, method overriding, and abstraction<br>

My preferred IDE for Java is Intellij IDEA, and ocassioanlly Eclipse
